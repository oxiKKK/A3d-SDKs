# A3d Software Development Kit Collection
The repository contains official Software Development Kits (SDKs) from Aureal 3D. These were found somewhere veeery deeply on the internet/internet archive. I've stored them here so you don't have to search for them - it wasn't an easy task to find these (at least for me).

If you have any other versions, that aren't mentioned here, of official A3D SDKs, please, feel free to contact me.

AFAIK There are versions even before 1.2, perhaps somewhere on the internet even deeper? I don't know. Some of the versions are mentioned inside the release notes inside individual SDKs however, I couldn't find these anywhere on the internet so, if you managed to somehow obtain these, feel free to contribute.
