Aureal A3D 3.0 SDK
Release Notes



A3DAPI Build v3.1
February 11, 2000
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first public release of the A3D 3.0 SDK.
Feature additions, bug fixes, and known issues will be updated here,
as new SDK releases are made.

Features Added:
 * See Readme.txt and the new 3.0 Documentation for a complete list of features.


Bug(s) Fixed:

 * This is the first release. Bug fixes in subsequent releases will appear here.


Known Issues:

 * This is the first release.
   Known issues: these drivers have undergone testing on Aureal
   and non-Aureal h/w. However, they have not been tested on all
   platforms or all card and driver configurations.
   We believe the feature set should be functional on all platforms,
   with the following caveats:
 
   Win2K: Reverb is currently not available on Win2K.
          Until final release of Win2K, Aureal cannot guarantee
	  that A3D will work on the OS. We have, however, tested core
          A3D 3.0 features on Win2K and believe they are functional.
