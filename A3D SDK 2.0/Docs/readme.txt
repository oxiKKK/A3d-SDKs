A3D 2.0 Software Development Kit
8 March 1999


Welcome to A3D 2.0, the industry-leading 3D audio standard. The Aureal A3D 2.0 
Software Development Kit (SDK) includes everything necessary to build a complete 
sound engine including 3D positional audio and other features into your next 
software application. Included in the kit are the following:

	A3D 2.0 API Reference Guide
	A3D 2.0 User’s Guide
	Source code and sample A3D 2.0 applications
	Code support files
	Release notes
	A3D drivers
	A3D logos
	Portable A3D demo
	Aureal Wavetracing technology demo
	Minerva test application
	Marketing presentation
	Vortex audio controller data sheets


The A3D 2.0 API Reference Guide
This is the heart of the SDK. The A3D 2.0 API Reference Guide contains a 
complete list of A3D 2.0 functions, their descriptions, structures, and error 
codes. This is where you find the actual code that makes A3D 2.0 work. As new 
features are added to A3D 2.0, the release notes will be updated and you will 
find the actual code in the reference manual. An index of A3D 2.0 functions 
is included for easy reference.

The A3D 2.0 User's Guide
This document contains all the information you need (aside from the actual 
API reference manual, which details specific code) to add support for A3D 2.0 
into your application. It has been separated from the actual A3D 2.0 API 
reference for your convenience. 

Source Code and Sample A3D 2.0 Applications
Also known as tutorials, we have included some very simple applications which 
utilize A3D 2.0, along with the source code used to compile them. This enables 
you to see what complete A3D 2.0 code looks like up front. Starting from the 
sample code, you can make changes and recompile to experiment with settings 
and other parts of the code.

Code Support Files
Included with the SDK are the necessary static library files (with source) 
and header files to compile with your application.

Release Notes
This is where you will find the latest information regarding the status of 
the A3D 2.0 SDK and its contents.

A3D Drivers
Included with the SDK are the latest available drivers (debug and release) 
that A3D uses to interface with your sound card. These drivers are updated 
often and are also available on our website (www.a3d.com) for your convenience. 
To see exactly what the A3D code is doing at a given time, you can use the 
debug drivers to step through the code and receive valuable debug information.

A3D Logos
Included with the SDK are various versions (MAC, PC, PhotoShop, Illustrator, 
etc.) of the A3D logo. Although A3D 2.0 works any audio hardware, it works 
best with A3D-enabled hardware. Let your customers know that you support 
their hardware to the fullest by displaying this logo on the box and your 
web site. 

Portable A3D Demo
We have put together an A3D Demo that runs on any Macintosh or PC machine. 
Using the output of an A3D sound card we recorded some audio files of A3D in 
action and encoded it in a linear format that plays on any computer (PC). 
Although it is better to use A3D hardware in a interactive demonstration, 
this demo can still be used to demonstrate rather than explain the benefits 
of A3D. For a real-life A3D demo check the A3D control panel included with 
your A3D sound card or run the Wavetracing demo included in the SDK.
(Available only on the SDK CD)

Aureal Wavetracing Technology Demo
Optimally supported by Vortex2-based A3D cards, this demo works on any A3D 
sound card. It very clearly demonstrates the benefits of Aureal Wavetracing 
technology, a key feature of A3D 2.0. Move sound sources, the listener, and 
walls around to dynamically affect the A3D experience.
(Available only on the SDK CD)

Minerva Test Application
Minerva is a testing and profiling tool for audio drivers and cards. Minerva 
tests for compatibility with and features of DirectSound, DirectSound3D, and 
A3D.
(Available only on the SDK CD)

Marketing Presentation
A simple PowerPoint presentation file about marketing opportunities with 
Aureal and Aureal's partners.
(Available only on the SDK CD)

Vortex Product Briefs
These documents detail the specifications and features of Aureal's popular 
PCI audio controllers and A3D accelerators, the Vortex chipset.
(Available only on the SDK CD)
